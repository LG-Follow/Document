\begin{abstract}
    Imagine an office worker getting ready for work in the morning, listening to music or the news through an AI speaker. During the morning routine, they might wash up in the bathroom, make coffee in the kitchen, have breakfast, choose clothes from the closet, and get dressed. For someone who moves between rooms so frequently, it's almost impossible to catch 100\% of the audio output from a stationary AI speaker.
    
    We are introducing technology that called LG Follow allows sound to follow the user, creating an environment where they can hear audio in any part of the house with LG appliances equipped with speakers.
    
    We will use a Raspberry Pi and PIR sensors to detect the user's location. The location information will be sent to a central control system, the AI speaker. For instance, if they leave the living room and enter the bedroom, the speaker in the living room will stop, and the speaker in the bedroom will automatically take over, seamlessly continuing the audio experience. Matter protocol manages the communication between Raspberry Pi and the AI speaker.
    
    Additionally, we provide an app called Sound Sketch that turns children's drawings into songs using generative AI. When a child draws a picture, the AI will create a song based on their own music. Through generative AI, the drawings will be transformed into prompts, and those prompts will be turned into music. With LG Follow, kids can enjoy listening to their own music as they move around the house, making each moment truly unique and magical.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

\subsubsection{We wanted to create an experience where the sound follows the user, ensuring uninterrupted audio no matter where they are in the house. With LG appliances equipped with speakers, the user can now enjoy continuous sound as they move from room to room, eliminating the frustration of missing important parts of the music or news.
Our motivation goes beyond just convenience, it’s about creating an immersive and seamless audio experience that adapts to the user's movement. By integrating AI and smart home appliances, we aim to make daily life smoother and more enjoyable.}
\

\subsubsection{Our motivation for making Sound Sketch from a desire to bring children's creativity to life in a magical way and to strengthen the bond between parents and their children. Children often express their imagination through drawing, and we wanted to elevate that experience by transforming their artwork into personalized music. With the power of generative AI, a simple drawing becomes a unique, original song, giving children a new way to connect with their creations.
What makes this experience even more special is the opportunity for parents and children to collaborate. By drawing together and hearing their joint artwork turned into a song, they can build memories and strengthen their connection through a shared creative process. With LG Follow, these songs can accompany them throughout the house, creating a sense of togetherness and joy, wherever they go.
Our goal is to seamlessly blend creativity and technology, offering families a fun and interactive way to bond while engaging with music that feels personal and meaningful. Every moment becomes truly unique and magical as they hear their imagination come to life.}


\
\subsubsection{We’ve made LG Follow and Sound Sketch easy to use by integrating them into the ThinQ app, ensuring both features are conveniently controlled in one place. With LG Follow, users can easily turn off the speaker in any appliance if they don’t want sound in a specific room. Meanwhile, Sound Sketch lets you transform children's drawings into songs, bringing creativity to life in a fun way. Everything is accessible and simple to control from the app, making the entire experience smooth, personalized, and user-friendly.}

\subsection{Problem statement (client’s needs)}

In today’s homes, AI speakers are commonly used to play music or news, but they are limited by their stationary nature. For someone who moves frequently between rooms during their morning routine—such as washing up in the bathroom, making coffee in the kitchen, or getting dressed in the bedroom—it becomes nearly impossible to catch all the audio from a single fixed speaker. This leads to a frustrating, interrupted experience where important parts of the audio are missed.

LG Follow solves this problem by allowing sound to follow the user throughout the house. As users move from room to room, LG appliances equipped with speakers provide continuous audio, eliminating gaps and ensuring they never miss a moment of music or news. This technology is designed to deliver a seamless and immersive audio experience, adapting to the user's movements to enhance their daily routine.

Additionally, we identified a need for families to engage creatively, leading to the development of Sound Sketch, an app that transforms children's drawings into personalized songs using generative AI. Children often express their imagination through drawings, and this feature elevates that creativity by turning their artwork into unique songs. It also offers parents and children the opportunity to bond through collaboration, creating memories as they hear their joint artwork come to life as music. By integrating LG Follow, these songs can follow the family throughout the house, adding a layer of joy and togetherness.

Both features, LG Follow and Sound Sketch, are integrated into the ThinQ app for ease of use, allowing users to control audio and manage drawings in one convenient place.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Handle Music Transitions via RTP and Matter Music transitions are handled using RTP for audio data transfer, while Matter protocol manages communication between speakers.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When music moves from the living room to another room, RTP streams the audio to the room speaker.\\
    \item Matter ensures that the correct speaker is selected based on the user’s movement.\\
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Speaker On/Off Functionality}

\subsubsection{Register Central Server for User Preferences To manage user preferences for music playback in certain rooms, the central server must communicate with the Raspberry Pi via MQTT and Matter.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Configure the central server to store user preferences for music playback in each room.\\
    \item Use MQTT to send this configuration to the Raspberry Pi.\\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Transmit User Preferences via MQTT serves as the lightweight message protocol to send the user's settings from the central server to the Raspberry Pi.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The central server sends an MQTT message containing the user's preferences (e.g., turn off music in a specific room).\\
    \item Raspberry Pi receives the MQTT message and applies the preferences.\\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Control Music Playback via Matter Raspberry Pi uses Matter to control music playback based on the user’s settings.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the user prefers no music in a specific room, Raspberry Pi prevents playback in that room.\\
    \item Matter ensures the speakers are controlled accordingly.\\
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Image Temporary Storage and Music CRUD}

\subsubsection{Image Temporary Storage}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When a user saves a drawing temporarily, Redis, a fast-access cache database, is used to store the image data. \\
    \item Redis acts as a memory-based storage solution that saves the temporary image data and allows for rapid retrieval when needed. This is particularly useful if the user pauses or edits the drawing, enabling them to resume their work later without data loss. \\
    \item By utilizing Redis, the app ensures quick access to the saved image while reducing latency and enhancing user experience during the drawing process.\\
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Music CRUD}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Once the drawing is transmitted to the Flask server, the image is stored temporarily in Redis, a memory-based cache, which allows fast retrieval of the drawing. This enables the user to pause or resume work on the drawing.\\
    \item The Flask server processes the request and ensures real-time streaming of the music, allowing users to listen to the song as soon as it's generated.\\
    \item For storage and long-term management of the generated music, the metadata and music links are handled by Spring Boot, which communicates with a MySQL database to store information such as the song title, date of creation, and the associated drawing theme.\\
    \item Users can perform CRUD operations on the generated music.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create: Saving the generated music to the database and S3 for long-term access.\\
    \item Read: Streaming the saved music from S3 and retrieving metadata from the database for display in the app.\\
    \item Update: Modifying the song’s metadata or regenerating the music by submitting a new drawing.\\
    \item Delete: Removing the music file from S3 and its metadata from the MySQL database, while ensuring Redis invalidates any cached data related to the deleted music.\\
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
